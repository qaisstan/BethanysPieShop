      <h1>Welcome to Bethany's Pie Shop!</h1>

      <h2>Our history</h2>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Bethany's Pie Shop, where pie-baking perfection meets
            convenience! For countless years, Bethany's passion for crafting
            the most scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. Our
            journey began in 2013 when we unveiled our first charming store
            in the heart of Brussels (Belgium), nestled in a cozy little street
            near the illustrious Grand Market. It was here that our pies first
            captured the hearts and taste buds of people from every corner of
            the globe, from delectable soft cakes to heavenly cheesecakes and
            tantalizingly spiced apple pies. Our store's extraordinary success
            was nothing short of a culinary fairy tale.</p>

      <p>As the demand for Bethany's divine creations soared, an incredible milestone was reached in 2015, when we
            proudly sold an astonishing 100 pies each day! Naturally, our beloved Pie Shop had to evolve, and we
            relocated to a grander, more spacious building to better serve our cherished patrons. The love and support
            we received from our ever-growing community inspired us to explore new possibilities.</p>

      <p>In response to numerous heartfelt requests from pie enthusiasts far and wide, we knew the time had come
            to bring our mouthwatering treats to your doorstep. Thus, in 2023, the idea of our very own webstore
            was born: a virtual haven where you can now relish the delight of ordering Bethany's scrumptious pies
            from the comfort of your own home, no matter where you reside in the world.</p>

      <p>What sets us apart, you ask? At Bethany's Pie Shop, we believe in using only the finest, handpicked ingredients
            to create each and every masterpiece. We meticulously source the freshest fruits, creamiest cheeses, and
            most aromatic spices to ensure that every bite of our pie is an unrivaled, tantalizing experience.</p>
